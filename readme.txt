== Description ==

Mobli.com is a photo and video sharing social network.

The widget shows user's latest Mobli images in a widget. Images are linked to Mobli.com, where all the user's Mobli images are visible.

This widget interacts with a service located on mobdmin.yampolsky.org. The widget sends the user name, number of images to display and the image width. Then, the service returns a preformed HTML that is displayed in the widget area. The parameters details are not being saved by the service.

The user can select to show his own stream or any other user stream.

The widget is simple and allows the user to select the maximum width of each photo and number of photos with a limitation of 10.

When the visitor will click on an image it will take him to the specific image page on Mobli.
